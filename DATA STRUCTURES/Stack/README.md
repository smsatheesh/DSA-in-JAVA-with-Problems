# STACK `( JAVA Version )` `( Data Structures & Algorithms )`

* It is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
* The order of operations may be  LIFO( Last In First Out ) or FILO( First In Last Out ).
* Real world example, arrangments of plates stacked over one another in canteen, houses, etc.,

## APPPLICATIONS OF STACK:
	
	* Functional calls
	* Recursion
	* Expression evaluation
	* Syntax Parsing
	* Management of memory
	
## ADVANTAGES:
	
	* Simplicity
	* Efficiency
	* Limited memory usage
	
## DISAVANTAGES:

	* Limited access
	* Potential for overflow
	* Limited capacity
