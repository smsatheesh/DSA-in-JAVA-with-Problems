# QUEUE `( JAVA Version )` `( DATA Strucutres & Algorithms )`

* It is a fundamental concepts in computer science where used for storing and managing data in specific order.
* It follows the principle of FIFO( First In First Out ) or LILO( Last In Last Out ).
* Real world examples are standing queue in managment of college, banks, traffic signals, etc.,

## [Implementations]( https://github.com/smsatheesh/DSA-in-JAVA-with-Problems/tree/main/DATA%20STRUCTURES/Queue/Linear%20Queue/Implementations )

## APPLICATIONS OF QUEUE :
	
	* Multi-programming
	* Network
	* Job-scheduling
	* Shared resources
	
## ADVANTAGES:

	* A large amount of data can be managed easily with efficiently
	* Operations such as insertion and deletion can be done easily since it follows the principle of FIFO or LILO
	* Queues are useful when a particular service is used by multiple consumers.
	* Queues are fast in speed for data inter-process communication.
	* Queues can be used in the implementation of other data structures.
	
## DISADVANTAGES:

	* The operations such as insertion and deletion of elements from the middle are time consuming.
	* Searching an element takes O(N) time.
	* Maximum size of a queue must be defined prior in case of array implementation.
