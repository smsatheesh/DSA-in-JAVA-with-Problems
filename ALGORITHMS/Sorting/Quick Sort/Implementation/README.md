# QUICK SORT `( JAVA Version )`

* It is one of the sorting algorithms based on `Divide and Conquer algorithm` that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in sorted array.
* The key process used for quick sort is _'partitioning'_

## ANALYSIS OF QUICK SORT:

	1. Time Complexity  -> O(N logN)
		1. Best case    -> O(N logN)
		2. Average case -> O(N logN)
		3. Worst case   -> O(N^2)
	2. Space Complexity -> O(1)
	
## ADVANTAGES:
	
	* It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that makes it easier to solve problems.
	* It is efficient on large data sets.
	* It has a low overhead, as it only requires a small amount of memory to function.
	
## DISADVANTAGES:
	
	* It has a worst-case time complexity of O(N2), which occurs when the pivot is chosen poorly.
	* It is not a good choice for small data sets.
