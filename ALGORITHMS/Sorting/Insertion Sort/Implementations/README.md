# INSERTION SORT `( JAVA Version )`

* It is a simple sorting algorithm that works in way that array is split into a sorted and unsorted part.
* Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed in the correct position in the sorted part.
* To sort an array of size N in ascending order, iterate over the array and compare the current element to its predecessor, if the current element is smallar than its predecessor, compare the elements to its before.
* Make a greater elements one position upward to insert in correct position to form sorted list.

## ANALYSIS OF INSERTION SORT:

	1. Time Complexity  -> O(N^2)
	2. Space Complexity -> O(1)
