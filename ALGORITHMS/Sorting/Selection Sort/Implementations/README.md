# SELECTION SORT `( JAVA Version )`

* It is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works repeatedly selecting the small ( or largest ) element from the unsorted array and moving to sorted position of the list.
* It involves picking small or larger number and performs swapping if found be greater or smaller elements in unsorted list to form sorted respectively.

## ANALYSIS OF SELECTION SORT:

	1. Time complexity -> O(N^2)
	2. Space complexity -> O(1)
	
## ADVANTAGES:

* Simple and easy to understand
* Works well with small datasets

## DISADVANTAGES:

* It have higher time complexity in both worst and average case scenario
* It does not works well on the large datasets.
