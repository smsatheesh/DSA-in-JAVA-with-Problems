# BUBBLE SORT `( JAVA Version )`

* It is the simplest sorting algorithm that involves repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are found to be in a wrong order.
* Intially, traverse elements from left and compare adjacent elements and place the higher elements on right side.
* In this way, higher elements are moved to the rightmost side of the list.
* This process is continued to find first, second, third largest elements and so on, thereby elements in the list are sorted well.

## ANALYSIS OF BUBBLE SORT:

	1. Time Complexity  -> O(N^2)
	2. Space Complexity -> O(1)
	
## ADVANTAGES:
	* It is easy to understand and implement
	* It does not require any additional space
	* It is stable sorting algorithm, i.e., elements with same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output
	
## DISADVANTAGES:
	* It has a time complexity of O(N^2) which makes very slow for large datasets.
	* It is comparsion based sorting algorithm, so that it can limit the efficiency of sorting algorithm in certain cases.
