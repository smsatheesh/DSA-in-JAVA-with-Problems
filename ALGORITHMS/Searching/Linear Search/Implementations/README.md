# LINEAR SEARCH `( JAVA Version )`

* It is a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element untill desired element is found, 
* otherwise search countinues till end of the data set.

## ANALYSIS OF LINEAR SEARCH:

	1. Time Complexity -> O(n)
		- Best case  -> O(1)
		- Worst case  -> O(n)
	2. Space Complexity 	-> O(1)
	3. Avearage comparisons -> [(n+1) / 2]
	
## ADVANTAGES:
	* Linear search can be used irrespective of whether the array is sorted or not. It can be used on arrays of any data type.
	* Does not require any additional memory.
	* It is a well-suited algorithm for small datasets.
	
## DISADVANTAGES:
	* Linear search has a time complexity of O(N), which in turn makes it slow for large datasets.
	* Not suitable for large arrays.
