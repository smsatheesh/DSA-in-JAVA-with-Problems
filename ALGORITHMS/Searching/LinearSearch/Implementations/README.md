# LINEAR SEARCH `( JAVA Version )`

* It is a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element untill desired element is found, 
* otherwise search countinues till end of the data set.

## ANALYSIS OF LINEAR SEARCH:

	1. Time Complexity -> O(n)
		- Best case  -> O(1)
		- Worst case  -> O(n)
	2. Space Complexity 	-> O(1)
	3. Avearage comparisons -> [(n+1) / 2]
