# BINARY SEARCH `( JAVA Version )`

* It is one of the divide and conqueror's algorithms, which is to be used on a sorted array by repatedly dividing and searching the key elemements accordingly.
* It also save the time complexity compared to other searches.

## ANALYSIS OF BINARY SEARCH:

	1. Time Complexity  -> O( log N )
		- Best case  	-> O( 1 )
		- Worst case 	-> O( log N )
	2. Space Complexity 	-> 0( 1 )

## ADVANTAGES:
	* Binary search is faster than linear search, especially for larger arrays.
	* More efficient than other sorting algorithms with similar time complexity.
	* It is well suited for large data sets stored on external memory, such as hard drive or cloud.
	
## DISADVANTAGES:
	* The array should be sorted.
	* It requires that the data structured being searched to be stored in contiguous memory locations.
