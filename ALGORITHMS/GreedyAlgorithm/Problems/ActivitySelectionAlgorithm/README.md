# Activity Selection Probalem on Greedy Algorithm ? `( JAVA Version )`

* The program already pre-defines the input to the problem
* This program applies greedy principle such that maximum pair of tasks( such as start & finish ) will be displayed.
* This is the example problems for `usages of Greedy Algorithm`.

>>> *** Grredy Algorithm *** is an algorithm paradigm such that it builds solution piece by piece, 
>>> always choosing the next piece that offers the obvious for the best at the moment, 
>>> therby obtaining optimal solutions to the complete problem.
