# Fisher Yates Algorithm `( JAVA Version )`

* It is an efficent algorithm used for shuffling elements of an iteratable variable such as arrays, list.
* The main assumption used over here is that, generate a random number and iterate over from last such that each iteration is done internal swapping with the selected element.
* It eventually shuffle elements inside and produce unbiased element arrangements.

## ANALYSIS :

	1. Time Complexity  -> O( N ), assumption random() takes O( 1 ) time
	2. Space Complexity -> 0( 1 )
